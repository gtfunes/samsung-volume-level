# Samsung Volume Level

Samsung Volume Level is a CLI application that connects to Samsung TVs and acts as an automatic volume manager. Using your device's microphone, it listens to the current volume output of your TV and automatically adjusts the volume if it's too high or too low. Additionally, it can function as a remote control, allowing you to manage volume, channels, and more directly from your terminal.
